# testing custom hooks

## Takeaways

> All right, I know what you've all been waiting for, you want to know how to test custom hooks. I don't know, maybe this will disappoint you, but _testing custom hooks is something you probably shouldn't do_.

> Most of the time, the custom hooks that you make are going to be used by one, maybe two components. You should just test those components and then your hook is going to be tested as _an implementation detail of those things_.

> However, _if you are building a reusable hook, or you have a library of hooks, or something like that_, then yeah, that's a pretty good situation for testing a custom hook, but the way that your software is going to be used is within a component. Maybe that's how you should test a custom hook.

## Background

Testing custom hooks is a common question as well. Step back and think about how
our guiding testing principle applies to this situation: the more your tests
resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you.
How is your custom hook used? It's used in a component! So that's how it should
be tested.

Often, the easiest and most straightforward way to test a custom hook is to
create a component that uses it and then test that component instead.

## Exercise

In this exercise, we have gone back to our simple counter, except now that logic
is all in a custom hook and we need to test that functionality. To do that,
we'll make a test component that uses the hook in the typical way that our hook
will be used and then test that component, indirectly testing our hook.

## Extra Credit

### 1. ðŸ’¯ fake component

Sometimes it's hard to write a test component without making a pretty
complicated "TestComponent." For those situations, you can try something like
this:

```javascript
let result
function TestComponent(props) {
  result = useCustomHook(props)
  return null
}

// interact with and assert on results here
```

### 2. ðŸ’¯ setup function

Add tests titled:

1. allows customization of the initial count
2. allows customization of the step

And test those use cases. Then abstract away the common logic into a `setup`
function. This one might be a little tricky thanks to variable references, but I
know you can do it!

ðŸ’° Here's a little tip. Due to variable references, you'll need to change your
test component a bit:

```javascript
const results = {}
function TestComponent(props) {
  Object.assign(results, useCustomHook())
  return null
}

// interact with and assert on results here
```

### 3. ðŸ’¯ using react-hooks testing library

Your `setup` function is very similar to the `renderHook` function from
[`@testing-library/react`](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library)!
Swap your own `setup` function with that!

> NOTE: Originally this exercise used `@testing-library/react-hooks` which was
> similar, but that functionality was merged directly into
> `@testing-library/react` so you're going to use that instead.
